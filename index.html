    <p>Hello there. Did you know that white text on white backgrounds exist?</p>
    <p>Here's the first hint:</p>
    <p class="white">
        I have no legs, yet I climb,
        I take you up and down in time.
        With buttons pressed, I start to go,
        Serving all, high and low.
    </p>
